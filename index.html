          Recent work in epistemology defends the unorthodox theses that belief is (1) an evidentially weak, and (2) question-sensitive attitude, and (3) that forming beliefs is sometimes a matter of guessing. What motivates these theses are examples of rationally permissible belief-ascriptions that exhibit these traits. The main aim of this paper is to outline a semantic account of categorical and conditional belief-ascriptions that captures the motivating data. We then survey some consequences of the proposed semantics, particularly with respect to the question of whether closure under rules of inference is rationally required for weak, question-sensitive belief.

        A standard account of conversational dynamics maintains a tight connection between the semantic content of a sentence and its assertive effect. Provided sentences express conditions on worlds, asserting a sentence amounts to eliminating worlds that do not meet the condition from the context set. Semantic expressivism about epistemic modals proposes that modalised sentences express conditions on information states rather than worlds. This paper develops an expressivist account of conversational dynamics that preserves the tight connection between semantic content and assertive effects by construing context sets as sets of information states rather than sets of worlds. The proposed account offers a unified treatment of the assertive effects and support conditions for both modalised and descriptive sentences, while serving as a conservative extension of the standard account.

	Recent work in epistemology defends the unorthodox theses that (1) belief is an evidentially weak, (2) question-sensitive attitude, and that (3) rationally permitted belief is sometimes a matter of guessing. These theses fit together naturally to form a unified account of weak, question-sensitive belief. A formal account of weak, question-sensitive belief as a coherent phenomenon is still forthcoming, however.
        
        The main aim of this paper is to develop a formal account that captures belief’s weakness and question-sensitivity in the setting of epistemic logic. We introduce a class of models in which the points of evaluation are situations, or world-evidence pairs, with evidence understood liberally to include sets of live possibilities, measures of uncertainty, and QUDs. A proposition is believed at a situation just in case it is implied by the most informative probabilistically dominant answer to the QUD, on some way of specifying the threshold of probabilistic dominance.
        
        The second aim of the paper is to explore two sets of epistemological implications in our formal setting. First, we consider whether beliefs are preserved between situations upon shifting the QUD parameter; specifically, we consider whether beliefs are preserved upon updating with learned information, under refining and coarsening questions, and whether belief is closed under conjunction. Second, we consider the interaction of knowledge and belief; specifically, we consider whether the principles governing the interaction of knowledge and belief in Stalnaker’s <b>KD45</b> also hold in our setting.

        By a familiar argument, contingentists cannot accept both the Being Constraint and the principle of λ-Abstraction, on pain of necessitism. Given the wide endorsement and intuitive plausibility of these two principles, contingentists might be faced with an unpalatable choice. A plausible way out for contingentists is weakening the Being Constraint so that the argument for necessitism fails to go through. This article considers the prospects of such a strategy. The article has two aims: First, I schematise the weakening strategy and situate two kinds of weakening proposed in the literature within this schema; Second, I propose two arguments for necessitism that go through even on the weakened version of the Being Constraint. I conclude that this should shake our confidence in there being a sufficiently weak Being Constraint.

      Higher-order contingentism is often motivated by constraints on what it takes for properties and propositions to exist, where the constraints involve the existence of first-order entities. A plausible strategy maintains that, provided a property or proposition is <em>about</em> some individual, it fails to exist at worlds at which the individual fails to exist. However, extending this strategy beyond examples requires a general theory of aboutness for entities of higher types. This article looks at two extant approaches to aboutness—the fine-grained structured approach and the coarse-grained Lewisian approach—and the higher-order contingentist accounts thereby motivated. I argue that such theories of aboutness either overgenerate or undergenerate.

         A strand of nominalist fictionalism about mathematics captures the truth conditions of mathematical statements by counterfactually supposing the existence of abstract objects. Provided nominalism holds of necessity, the resulting counterfactuals are counterpossibles. On the orthodox semantics for counterfactuals, counterpossibles are vacuously true. Adopting the orthodox semantics for counterfactuals thus trivialises counterfactualist fictionalism. This article outlines a novel variant of counterfactualist fictionalism that is not trivialised by the orthodox semantics.

            My Honors Thesis (2024/5 academic year) is on explanation; I put forward an argument for the question-sensitivity of explanation and consider consequences of question-sensitivity for the notion of explanation. <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andjovi/ajovicevic/main/HandoutEQS.pdf">[Handout]</a>

	    This thesis outlines and defends an argument for the question-sensitivity of explanation. The argument is as follows: Since explanation is a pre-theoretic notion, an adequate theory of explanation matches (most) pre-theoretic judgments of adequacy about sentences citing reasons why something is the case. Since judgments of adequacy about e-ascriptions are question-sensitive, an adequate theory of explanation predicts the question-sensitivity of explanation. But then the relation of explana- tory dependence is question-sensitive. We defend the argument’s con- clusion by justifying the claims (i) that explanation is a pre-theoretic notion, (ii) that adequate theories of pre-theoretic notions match (most) pre-theoretic judgments, and (iii) that pre-theoretic judgments about explanatory adequacy are sensitive to why-questions. After defending the conclusion, we outline some consequences for (i) the ontological, or worldly character of explanation and (ii) the asymmetry of explanation.
